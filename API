							Introduction to Spring Framework
							--------------------------------
Q> How many types of applications we develop using Spring Framework?
-> Spring supports multiple types of applications development types, almost all the applications types
   equal to JEE applications.
   
Q> Then, Why should we use Spring Framework when we can do the same using JEE?
-> - JEE stands for Jakarta Enterprise Edition and it is an API.
   - API stands for Application Programming Interface.
   - API is a collection of interface and abstract class.
   - Interfaces means "Classes" Provided by lang to develop/program application are called as API.
   - API are provided by lang., So that developers can develop application using lang. provided
     class easily.

   - It's very difficult in writing a java program to talk directly to database, because we need
     to write low-level code in communicating over the network understand protocols etc.
	 
   - Java Standard API, these api's contains only interface, abstract class they don't have 
     concerte classes. The implementation of the api will have concrete classes
	 
   - API's are abstract in nature. [these are not complete].
